## ➼ Neovim

*⁃ Copy the directory to ~/.config/nvim and then open lua/plugins/init.vim*

*⁃ Run :luafile % and then :PackerSync (Requires nvim packer to be installed)*

*⁃ Go to lua/lsp-config/language-servers.lua and read the comments for required packages.*

*⁃ I suggest taking only snippets from my config rather than the whole thing.*
